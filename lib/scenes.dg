%% Approximation of Inform scenes; scenes can be in progress or not; scenes can repeat.
%% Scenes are triggered by an initial condition, and end with another condition.
%% Scenes can be linked such that one scene starts when another begins.

%% Scenes have the (scene $) trait.

%% Scenes supply the (start $) predicate, which succeeds when the scene begins;
%% the predicate should also perform any state updates and provide any narration pertaining
%% to the start of the scene.

%% Started scenes will receive the flag ($ in progress) and ($ has started).

%% Scenes must supply the (complete $) predicate, the counterpart to (start $); 
%% when this succeeds, the ($ in progress) flag is cleared, and the ($ has completed) flag
%% is set.

%% On each tick, scenes complete before new scenes start; this allows scenes to start triggered
%% by other scenes being just completed.

%% By default, scenes execute once (once a scene has completed, there are no further checks
%% to see if it should start).
%% Scenes with the (recurring $) trait can start again even once completed.

%% The predicate (scene debugging enabled) will enable debug output as scenes are started, completed, or 'ticked'.

%% Each scene that is in progress at the start of the tick and not completed during the tick
%% is notified via this predicate.  It doesn't matter whether this predicate succeeds or fails.
