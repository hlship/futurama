%% TODO: Maybe an "utterance" since NNYers should say "Statue of Liberty" not "Liberty Island"
(look *)
    You are on Liberty Island, at the base of the Statue of Liberty. This is one of the most remote
    extensions of the transport tube system.
    A single transport tube extends from here back north, over the Hudson
    river, to Manhattan proper.
