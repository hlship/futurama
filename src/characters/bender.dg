(name *) Bender
(proper *)
(dict *) robot friend
(male *)
(appearance *)
    Bender, your not-exactly-trusty robot friend and co-enabler, lounges nearby.
(descr *)
    Bender is human shaped ... head, torso, arms and legs ... but would never be
    mistaken for anything but a shiny metal monstrosity.
    There's a gleam in his vision tubes that too often leads to petty larceny
    and other hyjinx.
(narrate greeting *)
    You turn to Bender.
