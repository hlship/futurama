(#jacket is #wornby *)
(descr *)
    Being in cold storage for a thousand years didn't change the 'classic' Fry look:
    red jacket, white T-shirt, slight slouch.

#wrapper
(item *)
(name *) candy-bar wrapper
(dict *) note
(descr *)
    Written on the inside of the wrapper, in crayon, is the urgent
    message: "WORK PANLET EXPERS GO!", but you are not sure what that means.

#slurm
(item *)
(name *) can of Slurm
(dict *) soft drink
(potable *)
(descr *)
    An empty can of Slurm soft drink.
    (if) (* has ancestor #fry)
    (then)
        You hold onto it with a desperate junkie's grip.
        "Maybe it has just one more delicious drop?" you think and
        give it a quick shake.
        No dice.
    (endif)
(narrate dropping *)
    With considerable mental effort, you convince your fingers to open, 
    allowing the can to drop free of your grasp.
    You never feel quite right without a can of Slurm handy, even an empty one.
(narrate taking *)
    Ah. Better. Back where it belongs.
(prevent [drink *])
    You tip the can towards your mouth, hoping against hope that there's even one more
    drop of precious Slurm in there.
    There isn't.

(name *) red jacket
