[Futurama: Honk If You Like Bytecode]

You wish you could say this is the first time you've woken up in a dark, dirty
alley... really, you wish you could say for sure. You can't seem to remember.
You feel a bit disoriented, and your tortured neurons cough up just a couple of
memories... you were out on a bender, or out with a Bender? A loud buzzing sound
startles you out of your reverie, as a fast moving, colorful blur whizzes by
overhead.

Alley
A short alley not far from Planet Express, notable for being dark and dingy in
an otherwise bright and colorful city. The alley is divided in two by a tall
fence, topped with razor wire, to the east. A busy street is just outside the
alley to the west. There's not much activity here, beyond a pair of owls who
watch you carefully, eager to scavenge any crumbs you might drop. At the back of
the alley is a graffiti-festooned dumpster on top of which is perched a precious
can of Slurm!

Whatever woke you up zoomed off, out of sight, beyond the neighboring rooftops.

You walk west.

Access Road
You are next to a wide access road frequented by heavy freight skimmers moving
north and south at high speed. From here you can see a portion of the Manhattan
skyline, all glittering spires and transport tubes endlessly flowing with
passengers. You can see the transport tube servicing Planet Express across the
road from you to the west; beyond that is the river. People are everywhere,
moving north and south along the street and zipping in and out of the transport
tube system.

parent-id: 1728874698431
command: enter tube
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> enter tube
You shuffle on to the end of the fast moving line. The New New Yorkers ahead of
you flit off to all parts of the city. Before you know it, you're at the head of
the queue. You duck your head and walk inside the transparent bubble. A raspy,
elderly voice, barely recognizable as a woman's, announces, "What's your,
whadjamacallit, destination?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
id: 1728874698433
parent-id: 1728874698432
command: say planet express
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The raspy voice responds: "How about announcing someplace with a tube innit,
will ya?"

A New New Yorker elbows past you impatiently, announces "Planet Express," and is
immediately sucked up into the tube system and away.

"I'd like to go to Planet Express," you announce.

With a sound like a great Tupperware container lid being opened, the tube sucks
you in and hurtles you about New New York. You catch fleeting glances of Madison
Cube Garden, the Robot Arms Apartments, and Liberty Island before you are spat
out of the reversal chamber at Planet Express. You roll gracelessly back onto
your feet and look around.

Planet Express
You are standing outside Professor Farnsworth's curious tower of science and
commerce, situated on a parcel of industrial real-estate adjacent to the river.
Planet Express is an oddly shaped red building, consisting of a largely conical
tower, attached to a large blocky hangar for the delivery ship itself. On the
side of the building is a wide circular door which is currently rolled shut. To
the east, beyond a blur of fast moving freight skimmers, is the access road.
Fortunately, the transport tube system extends this far.

From the upper turret of Planet Express, you hear Professor Farnsworth's
demanding, querulous voice call out to you: "Fry! Where have you been? We're
about to start a very dangerous mission and we're going to need someone to mop
up the blood, er, I mean, provide moral support. Get on in here!" He disappears
back into the tower.

You walk in through the circular door.

Conference Room
The conference room is the central hub of Planet Express, the place where most
of the griping and chit-chat takes place, outside of the occasional delivery
mission. A large circular conference table sits in the center of the room,
loomed over by a huge video display monitor. A metal railing divides this room
from the hangar. A steep set of stairs lead down into the hangar. The circular
door leading back out to the access road is open.

Bender, your not-exactly-trusty robot friend and co-enabler, lounges nearby.

You hear the Professor's voice above you: "Good News, Everyone!" His oversized
chair descends from the upper levels on two telescoping arms, which retreat back
into the ceiling after depositing him at the head of the conference table. He
continues: "I have a new and incredibly dangerous mission for you!"

You sit down at the conference table. Bender sits down as well, leaning far back
into his chair with his feet stretched out on the table.

You could ask about the new mission.

"Hiya, Bender," you say. "Backatcha, meatbag" he replies.

probably best for you to get back to his mission briefing.

"So, Professor, you said something about a mission?" you ask.

"The, oh, what?" The Professor seems confused for a moment, then remembers:
"Yes, yes, you must make a delivery to Miri Alpha Prime. Very dangerous, I'm
afraid." Hearing this, Bender asks "Is it the kind of danger only fragile meat
bags need to worry about, or is it real danger?" The Professor ignores him.

You could ask about the danger or ask about the Mirians.

command: danger

"What's so dangerous about this mission, Professor?" you ask.

"Oh, the Ellisonium, yes, the bitterest, mostly-stable element in the known
universe. Who knows what strange and terrible uses the Mirians will use it for!
Make their deserts bloom? A snap! Change the orbit of their moon? Easy as pie!
Or wage horrific intergalactic war? It's their choice, but that doesn't matter
really, it's their payment that's so dangerous."

You could ask about the Mirians or ask about the payment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

parent-id: 1728874698442
command: payment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> payment
You try to tease some useful information out of the old codger. "And their
payment is?" you ask. You're really hoping the Mirians pay in Slurm.

The Professor becomes agitated and raises his voice. "Just the most dangerous
machine in the known galaxy... The Guardian of Forever!" He settles down after a
moment. "I'm getting it for quite a steal, actually. And really, it shouldn't be
so dangerous as long as you don't go fooling around with it! Maybe you'll listen
to Leela for once... where is she?"

You could ask about the Guardian of Forever or suggest finding Leela.

"So Professor, what exactly is this Guardian thing?"

The Professor responds a bit crankily: "It's a machine that needs to be
delivered back here to Planet Express." He looks at you. "By a delivery boy."

You could ask about the Mirians or suggest finding Leela.

You ask "Well, what are these Mirians like?"

"Oh, they're just ordinary folks," says the Professor, "at least by our
standards. Ordinary folks who want to ruthlessly command the forces of Nature
and perhaps commit unspeakable intergalactic crimes. You know, a race of
scientists much like me. I'm connected to some of the leading Mirians on
LinkedIn. That's how I knew they were desperate for the Ellisonium in the first
place!"

You could suggest finding Leela.

"Very good. You find Leela, grab this mechanical buffoon," he gestures towards
Bender, who arches his vision tubes and blows out a puff of noxious cigar smoke,
"and get that Ellisonium delivered!"

The Professor pushes back from the table, and punches a button on his chair. The
telescoping arms return, grab the chair, and raise it up into the ceiling. You
and Bender stand up as well.

You climb down.

Delivery Ship Hangar
This very large room, the largest open space inside Planet Express, is where the
delivery ship is parked. The floor is heavy concrete, capable of supporting the
great mass of the ship, but still showing stains, scorches, and wear marks. A
row of lockers lines one side of the hangar, and a steep flight of stairs,
almost a ladder, leads back to the conference room.

The Planet Express Delivery Ship overshadows everything else in the hangar,
resting on three huge landing struts. It stands ready for the next mission, or
the next whim of the Professor.

Off to one side is a cylindrical container, about a foot high, with a clear dome
on top.

Leela is fussing about the hangar, checking that the ship is ready for its next
mission.
